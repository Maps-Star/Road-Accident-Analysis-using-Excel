I created an excel dashboard to analyze Road accidents data for different stakeholders such as Ministry of Transport, Transport Department, Police Force, Road Safety, Transport 
Operators, the General public and the media etc. The project involved cleaning and transformation of data using power query, Data processing, adding important new columns, using Pivot tables and charts for analyzing data, formulas, formatting it to create an insightful and interactive dashboard. 

MAIN KPIs: This involved the severity of casualties for both 2021 and 2022.

➡️Slight Casualties: 351,436
➡️Casualties by Car: 333,485 
➡️Serious Casualties: 59,312 
➡️Fatal Casuaties: 7,135

Charts used:
1.Doughtnut Chart - for Categorizing the Casualties  and size of percentage distribution based on accident severity
2.Bar Chart - For recognizing casualties by Road type
3.Line Chart - For analyzing the monthly trend of casualties for  2021 and 2022.
4.Tree map- for Categorising casualties by Road surface conditions.

Filters used:
*Year
*Area/Location

Key Highlights:

#Highest casualties were recorded on Cars both in rural and urban areas with Slight casualties of 351k being recorded as the highest accident severity, followed by serious casualties (59.3k and Fatal casualties as the lowest(7.1k). This was mainly in dry road surfaces.

#Single carriage way road type also recorded the highest casualties of 309.7k, this may be due to motorists not exercising courtesy to other road users.

#More casualties were recorded in the urban areas during daylight as compared to night time, this could be due to overspeeding and other related factors.

#There is a reduction in the number of casualties recorded in 2022 as compared to the prior year, this clearly indicates that motorists had become more careful by adhering to traffic rules. 

Key Takeaways: Using Pivot tables, Power query for data ceaning and transformation, charts and statistical formulas played a huge role for quicker analysis.
